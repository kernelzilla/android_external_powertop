It's not our intention to have long term kernel patches for PowerTOP.
However, occasionally we develop PowerTOP features that involve a kernel
patch. We'd like our users to be able to use these latest features without
having to wait upto 3 months for Linus to make a release with the kernel
portion.

We'll remove the patches in this directory aggressively as Linus
releases kernels with these patches included.
